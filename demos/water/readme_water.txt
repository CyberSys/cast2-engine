To compile the source add the engine source path (with all subdirectories) to search path of your compiler.
Sample fpc.cfg for Free Pascal included. You need only to change path to FPC and engine root to yours.
For some reason, .exe compiled by FPC with optimization level 2 or greater (G2 option) are crashing.
