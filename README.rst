.. _Base: http://github.com/casteng/base.git

The key points of the engine:
 - WYSIWYG world editor - a single tool to edit any aspect of the game world in real time. All the engine features are available in the editor.
 - Compatibility - the engine system requirements are lowest - its material system which is based on techniques approach allows to render the same scene with modern video hardware and with such old hardware as Intel 815 integrated video or Riva TnT.
 - Platform and API independent - any platfrom or API specific code is isolated and can be easily reimplemented for another platform/using other API. The source code is compatible with Free Pascal Compiler and Linux/MacOS X platforms are planned in the future.
 - Performance - the engine is designed and implemented to get highest performance possible. Render states/shader/render target changes are minimized, vertex/index buffers are managed effectively and so on. In addition, performance profile updated in real time will give all information about performance issues.
 - Dynamics - almost all calculation are done in runtime. This allows to make significant changes to game world on the fly.
